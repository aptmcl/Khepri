Here is the process for updating Khepri

=#

# The Khepri Julia project itself is stored at

After updating something in the plugin, just call this function:

Pkg3 is not yet ready. We need to manually generate REQUIRE
=#

import Pkg
const PT = Pkg.Types

generate_require(dir=julia_khepri) =
    begin
        Pkg.activate(dir)             # current directory as the project
        ctx = PT.Context()
        pkg = ctx.env.pkg
        if pkg â‰¡ nothing
            @error "Not in a package, I won't generate REQUIRE."
        else
            @info "found package" pkg = pkg
        end
        deps = PT.get_deps(ctx)
        non_std_deps = sort(collect(setdiff(keys(deps), values(ctx.stdlibs))))
        open(joinpath(julia_khepri, "REQUIRE"), "w") do io
            for d in non_std_deps
                println(io, d)
                @info "listing $d"
